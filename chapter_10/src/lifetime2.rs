/*
 *Rules :  
 * 
 * 
 * The first rule is that the compiler assigns a lifetime parameter to each parameter thatâ€™s a
 * reference. In other words, a function with one parameter gets one lifetime parameter: 
 * fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32);
 * fn foo<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &'b i32);
 * 
 *  
 * The second rule is that, if there is exactly one input lifetime parameter, that lifetime is 
 * assigned to all output lifetime parameters
 * fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32) -> &'a i32
 * 
 * 
 * The third rule is that, if there are multiple input lifetime parameters, but one of them is 
 * &self or &mut self because this is a method, the lifetime of self is assigned to all output
 * lifetime parameters.
 * fn first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &'a str
